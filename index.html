				<br><br>
				<span>Moana is an independent traveler who loves the ocean. Despite her occasional bouts of self-doubt, she is fiercely proud of her identity and fearlessly tackles new challenges.

				<br><br>
				<span>Merida defies the traditional princess stereotype by being an independent, fearless, courageous, defiant, and obstinate young woman. She excels in archery and loves nothing more than spending time on her horse Angus, two of her many athletic pursuits. As the Brave featurette "Cutting the Class" shows, she is also obviously good with a blade. Because of her excessive tomboyishness, Merida often acts in an ungraceful manner and has terrible manners.</span> <br> <br>
